## 1. Immigration Agents Pulled from Minnesota Cities ![Article 1](/images/news/2026-02-05-1.png)

The Trump administration has decided to **pull** 700 immigration agents out of Minnesota. These agents were working to enforce immigration laws in the state. The government says this move is to focus resources in other areas. Many people in Minnesota are worried this will make it harder to manage immigration issues locally. This change could also affect communities that depend on the agents for help with immigration problems. The decision comes after debates about immigration policies and law enforcement priorities. We will have to watch how this affects immigration control in the coming months.

## 2. Private-Sector Hiring Slows Down in January ![Article 2](/images/news/2026-02-05-2.png)

In January, private companies added only 22,000 new jobs, which is much less than experts expected. This slow job growth shows that the US economy may be facing challenges. Many businesses are cautious about hiring because of uncertain economic conditions. The smaller number of new jobs can affect workers looking for better opportunities. Experts will watch future job reports to see if this is a short-term problem or a longer trend. This news is important because jobs are a key part of the economy’s health.

## 3. Silicon Valley Tech Workers Campaign Against ICE Presence ![Article 3](/images/news/2026-02-05-3.png)

Tech workers in Silicon Valley are starting a campaign to remove ICE, the immigration enforcement agency, from US cities. They believe ICE’s presence causes fear and harm in immigrant communities. These workers want companies and city leaders to stop supporting ICE activities. This campaign shows how tech employees are using their voices for social and political causes. It also reflects growing concerns about immigration policies and human rights. The movement may influence how cities deal with immigration enforcement in the future.

## 4. Supreme Court Lets California’s New Congressional Map Stay ![Article 4](/images/news/2026-02-05-4.png)

The US Supreme Court decided not to block California’s new congressional map. This map changes the boundaries for voting districts in the state. It was created after new population data showed changes in where people live. Some people worried the map would give unfair advantages to certain political groups. But the Court’s decision means the map will be used in upcoming elections. This is important because congressional maps affect who represents people in government.
