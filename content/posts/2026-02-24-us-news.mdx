## 1. Winter Storm Slams the East Coast ![Article 1](/images/news/2026-02-24-1.png)

A strong winter storm has hit the East Coast of the United States. The storm brought heavy snow, strong winds, and freezing temperatures to many cities. Schools and businesses had to close because of the dangerous weather. Airports canceled many flights, and roads became very slippery. This storm is one of the biggest this season and caused power outages in some areas. People were warned to stay indoors and be careful if they must travel. Weather experts say the storm will continue for a few more days before conditions improve.

## 2. Communities Create Protective Immigration Policies ![Article 2](/images/news/2026-02-24-2.png)

Some local communities in the United States are making new rules to protect immigrants. These policies help immigrants feel safer and supported. Even though some state and national governments have set roadblocks, these communities want to help people who are new to the country. Protecting immigrants can mean offering legal help, stopping unfair arrests, or giving access to important services. These actions show how local leaders care about their residents. The policies also create a friendly environment for immigrants to live and work. This issue is important because immigration affects many people and communities across the country.

## 3. U.S. Job Growth Slows Down in Early 2025 ![Article 3](/images/news/2026-02-24-3.png)

The United States added 130,000 jobs in January 2025, but experts say the growth in the job market is slowing. This means fewer new jobs are created compared to before. The labor market is important because it shows how many people can find work. When job growth slows, it can make it harder for people to get new jobs or raise wages. Some industries are still hiring, but overall the market feels calmer. Economists will watch these numbers closely to see if the trend continues or changes. This information helps the government and businesses make decisions about the economy.
