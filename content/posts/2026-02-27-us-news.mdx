The US immigration policies under the current administration remain a hot topic. Many people are **beyond shock and awe** at how strict and complicated the rules have become. The policies affect millions of families and workers who want to enter or stay in the country. Public disapproval has increased, especially before important government speeches. Some cities, like St. Louis, are having city-wide talks to understand how immigration laws work locally. These conversations try to explain the complicated rules and how they impact local communities. The future of immigration policy will likely continue to be a major political issue in the US.

## 3. Silicon Valley Faces Urgent Taiwan Chip Supply Risk ![Article 3](/images/news/2026-02-27-3.png)

Silicon Valley has long depended on Taiwan for computer chips, but now there is a **looming disaster** about this supply.

Recently, Washington has said this risk is no longer just a theory but a real danger. If Taiwan faces political or natural problems, the global tech industry could be hurt badly. Many businesses are starting to look for ways to reduce this risk by finding other suppliers. This issue is important because chips are inside almost all electronic devices today.
