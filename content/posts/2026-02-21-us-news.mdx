![Article 1](/images/news/2026-02-21-1.png)  

Former President Trump lost a Supreme Court case that stopped his plan to impose global tariffs. Now, he wants to use **different laws** to bring these tariffs back. Tariffs are taxes on imports that can protect American businesses but may also raise prices for consumers. Trump’s team believes these new laws will help them **get around** the legal problems they faced before. This plan could affect trade with many countries and change the global economy. Experts say we should watch closely because this might start trade conflicts. The government and businesses will need to prepare for possible changes in prices and trade rules.
