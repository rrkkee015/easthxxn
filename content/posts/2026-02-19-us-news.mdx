## 2. How US Immigration Policies Affect Families and Economy ![Article 2](/images/news/2026-02-19-2.png)

US immigration policies have changed a lot in recent years. These changes have caused problems not only for immigrants but also for the US economy. Many immigrants work in important jobs that keep the country running. Restrictions can hurt families by making it hard to reunite or get health care.

This issue shows how immigration affects everyday people and the economy.

## 3. Strong Start for US Job Market in 2025 ![Article 3](/images/news/2026-02-19-3.png)

The US job market began 2025 with a strong pace in hiring. Many companies are looking for workers to fill new jobs. Adding 130,000 jobs in January shows the economy still needs many employees. However, some experts say the labor market growth is slowing down. This slowdown could affect how fast the economy grows later. People looking for work may find good opportunities now, but it might get harder soon. The government and businesses will watch these changes closely.

Silicon Valley is known as a center for technology and innovation. It is home to many big tech companies that create new products and ideas.
