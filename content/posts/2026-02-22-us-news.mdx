Some communities in the United States are creating local immigration policies to protect immigrants, even when there are difficulties from state or national governments. These policies help immigrants feel safer and have better access to services like schools and healthcare. The goal is to create a welcoming environment for people who come from other countries. Sometimes, higher levels of government may try to stop or limit these efforts. But many cities and towns believe that protecting immigrants is important for their community’s success and safety.
