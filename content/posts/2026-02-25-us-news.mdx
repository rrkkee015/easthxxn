## 1. Trump’s Changing Promise on Tariff Refunds 

Former President Trump recently made a surprising change about tariffs. He first **promised** in court to give refunds to companies affected by tariffs. However, now he is **opposing** these refunds. This change has caused confusion and disappointment among businesses and workers. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, and refunds would help companies recover money they paid. This story is important because it shows how political decisions can affect the economy and people’s trust. We might see more debates or legal actions about this issue soon. Watching how leaders keep or change promises helps us understand politics better.
