## 3. Migrant Encounters at U.S.-Mexico Border Hit Lowest in 50+ Years ![Article 3](/images/news/2026-02-03-3.png)

Migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped to their **lowest level in more than 50 years**. This means fewer people are being caught trying to cross the border without permission. Experts say this could be because of new policies, better border control, or changes in migration patterns. This is important because it affects immigration debates and the resources needed at the border. Some people hope this means the situation is improving. Others worry it might not reflect the true number of people trying to enter. The government will continue to watch these numbers closely to decide future actions.
