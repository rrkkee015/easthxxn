The FBI is examining DNA found on a glove near a home in Guthrie. They believe this DNA **appears to match** the glove worn by a suspect in a recent crime. This is an important step because DNA can clearly link a person to the scene. The investigation could move faster if this match is confirmed. Police hope this evidence will help solve the case and find out what really happened. The community is watching closely as the FBI works to bring answers. This kind of forensic evidence is often very strong in court.

![Article 2](/images/news/2026-02-16-2.png)

This week’s immigration news shows that US immigration policy still plays a big role in the country’s future. Some policies have helped create strong ties with countries like India, especially in the tech field. For example, the US allowed many skilled workers from India to come and work in IT jobs. This helped both countries grow their economies. However, immigration rules are still changing, and many people are watching how the government manages detention centers and border control. The government says they want to keep things safe but also fair. Immigration remains a complex and important topic for many families.

![Article 3](/images/news/2026-02-16-3.png)

The US added 130,000 jobs in January, but experts say the **labor market growth stalled** after that. This means fewer new jobs were created compared to before. Some industries are hiring less, and the overall job growth is slower than last year. Still, the unemployment rate stayed about the same at 4.4%. Many people want to know if the job market will get stronger soon or slow down more. Economists watch these numbers closely because they affect how people spend money and how businesses plan. The government may respond with new policies to help the economy grow again.
