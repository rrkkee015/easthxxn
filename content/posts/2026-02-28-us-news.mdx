## 1. Trump Orders U.S. Agencies to Stop Using Anthropic AI Technology ![Article 1](/images/news/2026-02-28-1.png)

Former President Trump has ordered U.S. government agencies to **stop using** Anthropic’s artificial intelligence (AI) technology. This decision comes after a disagreement between the Pentagon and Anthropic about how the AI should be used. Anthropic is a company that builds smart computer programs designed to help with different tasks. The Trump administration’s move is important because many agencies rely on AI for security and data work. This ban could slow down AI development in the government. The tech industry is watching closely to see how this will affect future AI projects. For now, government agencies have to find other AI tools or wait until this issue is resolved.

## 3. U.S. Job Market Growth Slows in Early 2025 ![Article 4](/images/news/2026-02-28-4.png)

The U.S. added about 130,000 new jobs in January 2025, but experts say the **job market growth** is slowing down. This means fewer people are finding new work than before. A strong job market helps the economy because more people can earn money and spend it. However, when job growth slows, it can **affect the economy** by reducing spending and business profits. Economists watch these numbers carefully to predict if a slowdown or recession might happen. The government might use this information to decide on new policies to help workers and businesses.
