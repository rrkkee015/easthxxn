## 2. Silicon Valley Builds a Shadow Power Grid for Data Centers ![Article 2](/images/news/2026-02-23-2.png)

Silicon Valley companies are creating a special power system just for data centers across the United States. This system is like a **shadow power grid** that works separately from the regular electric grid. Data centers need a lot of electricity to run computers and store information. Sometimes the regular power grid can have problems or not provide enough energy. By building their own power grid, these companies want to make sure data centers stay **up and running** all the time. This is important because many services and websites depend on data centers. The new system could change how electricity is used in the future.
