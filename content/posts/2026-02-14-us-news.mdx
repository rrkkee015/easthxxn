## 1. Immigration Agents Possibly Lied About Minnesota Shooting ![Article 1](/images/news/2026-02-14-1.png)

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says some immigration agents may have **lied** about a shooting in Minnesota. This news is important because it raises questions about how immigration agents behave and if they are honest in their reports. The shooting happened during a police operation, and now investigators want to find out the truth. If agents lied, it could affect public trust and future immigration cases. The government might take action to improve transparency and accountability. This story shows how serious it is when people in power are not truthful. We will wait to see what the investigators find next.

## 2. U.S. Job Market Added 130,000 Jobs But Growth Slowed in 2025 ![Article 2](/images/news/2026-02-14-2.png)

In January 2025, the United States added about 130,000 new jobs, which is good news for workers. However, experts say the overall growth in the job market has **stalled**, meaning it is not growing as fast as before. This slow growth could affect workers and businesses in the coming months. Some sectors still hired many people, while others saw fewer jobs. Economists will watch these numbers closely to understand if the economy is getting stronger or weaker. This report shows that while jobs are still being created, the pace is slower than expected.
