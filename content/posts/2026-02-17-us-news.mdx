![Article 4](/images/news/2026-02-17-4.png)

The U.S. added 130,000 jobs in January, but experts say the job market growth is **stalled** in 2025. This means fewer new jobs are being created than before. A slow job market can affect the whole economy because people may have less money to spend. Some industries are growing, but others are struggling. Long-term unemployment is becoming more common, which worries many workers. Experts watch these trends to understand how the economy will change and to suggest ways to improve it. The government may take actions to support job growth in the coming months.
