## 4. January Job Cuts Rise While Hiring Hits Record Low [IMAGE_3]

In January 2025, many companies cut jobs, and hiring was the lowest ever recorded for that month. This means more people lost jobs than usual, and fewer new jobs were created. Experts say this shows the economy might be slowing down. Some workers worry about their future because the job market is not as strong as before. However, some companies are still hiring, but in smaller numbers. This trend could change if the economy improves or gets worse. Understanding these changes helps people prepare for what may come next in their careers.
