## 1. Communities Create Protective Immigration Policies Despite Challenges  
![Article 1](/images/news/2026-02-20-1.png)  

Many local communities in the US are making **protective immigration policies** to help immigrants stay safe. Even though state and national governments sometimes block these efforts, cities and towns still want to protect people who live there. These policies might include stopping local police from working with immigration agents. This is important because it helps immigrants feel safer and more included. Some leaders believe these rules can improve community trust. However, the national government may try to change or ignore these local laws. We will need to watch if these protective policies grow or face more roadblocks.

The US added 130,000 new jobs in January, but experts say the growth in the **labor market** is slowing down this year. The labor market means all the available jobs and workers in the economy. This slower growth could affect the whole economy, making things less certain for workers. Many companies are careful about hiring because of this uncertainty. Some workers may find it harder to get a new job or a raise. It is important to watch how the job market changes, as it can affect people’s daily lives. Experts suggest that being ready for changes can help workers find **stability** during uncertain times.

![Article 3](/images/news/2026-02-20-3.png)  

Silicon Valley companies are working on a special **shadow power grid** to provide electricity for data centers across the US. A shadow power grid is a separate energy system that can work independently from the main electric grid. Data centers need a lot of power to store and manage information from the internet and cloud services. This new grid helps avoid problems if the main power grid fails or has trouble. It also makes energy use more reliable for important tech services. This project shows how tech companies prepare for future energy needs and possible emergencies. The shadow grid might become a model for other industries soon.

![Article 4](/images/news/2026-02-20-4.png)  

Some tech workers in Silicon Valley are campaigning to get the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency out of cities. They want cities to stop cooperating with ICE because of concerns about immigration enforcement and treatment of immigrants. These workers use their voice and influence to support immigrants’ rights and push for local governments to protect them. This movement shows how employees in the tech industry can get involved in social and political issues. It also reflects a growing concern about immigration policies in the US. The campaign might change how cities and companies work with federal immigration agencies.
