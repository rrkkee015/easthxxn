A recent US-Israeli strike reportedly killed Iran’s supreme leader, causing a major crisis in the Middle East. This leader was very powerful and had a big influence on Iran’s government and military. The attack happened because of rising conflicts between Iran and these countries. This event could **disrupt** peace and make the situation more dangerous. Many countries are now watching closely to see what will happen next. Experts warn this could affect global oil shipments and increase violence. It is important because it could change political relationships worldwide.

More people in the US now disapprove of former President Trump’s immigration policies. This is happening just before the State of the Union speech, where the president talks about important issues. Many feel that these policies were too strict and hurt legal immigrants. Experts say it was never just about stopping illegal migration, but also about limiting legal immigration. This has caused harm to many families and workers who want to live and work in America. The debate continues as new leaders decide how to change immigration laws. This issue affects millions and shapes America’s future.

## 4. US Job Market Shows Signs of Slowing Hiring in 2026  
[IMAGE_3]  

Many company leaders, called CEOs, say they will not add many new jobs in 2026. This means the job market might become slower, with fewer people hired. Experts think this could be a “low-hire, low-fire” market, where companies do not hire many workers but also keep most current workers. The unemployment rate is still low, but growth in jobs is expected to be small. This trend could change how people look for work and how companies plan their future. It is important for workers to watch these changes and prepare. The economy is shifting to a more cautious phase.
