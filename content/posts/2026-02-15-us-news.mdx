![Article 1](/images/news/2026-02-15-1.png)  

US Senator Marco Rubio recently spoke to European leaders to **reassure** them of America's support. However, he made it clear that this help comes with a condition: Europe must **change course** in how it handles certain issues. Rubio’s message is important because Europe is facing challenges like security and energy problems. The US wants to help, but only if Europe takes new steps to solve these problems. This shows that international support is not automatic; it often depends on cooperation and shared goals. Leaders in Europe will now have to decide whether to follow Rubio’s advice. This could influence future US-Europe relations and policies.
