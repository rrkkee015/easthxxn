Many communities in the US are creating **protective policies** to support immigrants. These policies help immigrants feel safer and access services without fear.

The communities believe these protections are very important for building trust and fairness. If more places continue this work, it might change the way immigration is handled in the country. But challenges remain as laws and politics change. This story shows how people work together to support immigrants even when facing obstacles.
