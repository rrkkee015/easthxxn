## 1. Trump Repeals Government’s Power to Regulate Climate ![Article 1](/images/news/2026-02-13-1.png)

The U.S. government recently **repealed** its power to regulate climate. This means the government cannot enforce rules to reduce pollution as it did before. The decision has caused many people to worry because climate change is a serious problem. Experts say the repeal could make it harder to **address** global warming and protect the environment. Some believe this move will slow down progress in clean energy and increase pollution. The government says they want to focus on economic growth instead. This change may cause more debates in the future about the balance between business and the planet.

## 2. U.S. Added 130,000 Jobs in January, But Growth Stalled ![Article 2](/images/news/2026-02-13-2.png)

The U.S. economy added 130,000 jobs in January, which was a surprise for many experts. However, this number shows that the **labor market** is slowing down compared to before. The labor market means how many jobs are available and how many people want to work. Some industries are hiring more, but others are not growing. Experts think this slower growth might affect the economy in 2025. Workers may find it harder to get new jobs or raise their salaries. The government and businesses will watch the job numbers carefully in the coming months.
