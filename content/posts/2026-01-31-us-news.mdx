## 1. Senate Passes $1.2 Trillion Funding Deal, Shutdown Likely ![Article 1](/images/news/2026-01-31-1.png)

The U.S. **Senate** has passed a massive $1.2 trillion government **funding** deal. This means they have agreed on how to spend a large amount of money to keep the government running. However, even though the deal is approved, a brief **shutdown** is still expected. A shutdown happens when the government temporarily closes because it can't agree on a budget. It affects many government services and workers. The shutdown is likely to be short, but it shows how difficult it can be for lawmakers to agree on important issues. People are hoping the government will open again soon and continue working as usual.
