## 3. U.S. Job Growth Slows in Early 2025 ![Article 3](/images/news/2026-02-12-3.png)

In January 2025, the U.S. economy added 130,000 new jobs, but experts say the growth is slowing down. This means fewer new jobs were created than expected. The labor market, which is the place where people find work, is not growing as fast as before. Many workers find it harder to get new jobs or better pay. Some companies are cautious about hiring more people because of uncertain economic conditions. This slowdown can affect families and the overall economy. People will watch closely to see if job growth improves or continues to slow this year.
