![Article 1](/images/news/2026-02-10-1.png)

The Hoover Conference recently showed how **high-skill immigration** helps the United States in many ways. Skilled workers from other countries bring new ideas and talents that support innovation. This helps businesses grow and creates more jobs for everyone. Experts at the conference said the US should continue welcoming these workers. They believe this will keep America’s economy strong and competitive. The topic is important because immigration policies can change quickly. If the US stops skilled immigration, it could slow down progress in technology and science. Many people hope policy makers will understand these benefits and act accordingly.
