Many Americans watched former President Trump’s recent State of the Union speech with strong feelings. Some voters **reacted** positively, saying they liked his ideas about the economy and security. Others were more critical, concerned about his tone and the topics he focused on. The speech is important because it can influence public opinion and political debates. It also shows what Trump might focus on if he runs for president again. Understanding these reactions helps us see how divided opinions are in the US today. The coming months will show if these views will change or stay the same.

Public disapproval of the government’s immigration policies is growing as the State of the Union approaches. Many people feel the current rules are too strict or unfair. Some states, like Maine, are making new policies to protect immigrants in “sensitive locations” such as schools or hospitals. These policies try to create safer places where immigrants can get help without fear. Reports also show that welcoming immigrants can help states' economies grow. This topic is important because immigration affects many communities and the country’s future. We may see more debates and changes in immigration laws soon.

The US added 130,000 jobs in January, showing some growth in the labor market. However, experts say the overall job market growth is **stalled** this year. This means fewer new jobs are being created than expected, and hiring may slow down soon. Despite this, some areas are still hiring workers quickly, and companies want to fill open positions. How the job market changes will affect many people looking for work or planning their careers. Economists will watch these trends closely to see if the situation improves or gets worse.

## 4. Taiwan’s Chip Supply Risk Worries Silicon Valley  
![Article 4](/images/news/2026-02-26-4.png)

Silicon Valley depends a lot on computer chips made in Taiwan. Recently, experts warned about a **looming disaster** if a crisis hits Taiwan, such as a war or natural disaster. This could stop chip production and hurt many tech companies in the US. Washington now says the risk is no longer just a theory; it is a real concern. The chip shortage in the past showed how important these tiny parts are for phones, cars, and computers. Companies and the government may need to find new ways to secure chip supplies and reduce this risk. This issue is very important for the future of technology and the economy.
