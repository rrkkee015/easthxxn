A 5-year-old boy named Liam Conejo Ramos and his father have finally returned to their home in Minnesota. They were separated earlier when Liam was taken to an ICE facility in Texas. This reunion is important because many immigrant families face long times apart due to immigration policies. The government had kept Liam in the facility while his father was elsewhere, causing distress. Now, after some time, the family is back together. This story shows how immigration rules can deeply affect children and families. It also raises questions about how the government handles these situations in the future. Families hope that cases like Liam’s will lead to kinder policies.
