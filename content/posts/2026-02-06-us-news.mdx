## 1. New Developments in US Immigration Policy and Economy ![Article 1](/images/news/2026-02-06-1.png)

This week, there are important updates about US immigration. Some state treasurers, including from Nevada, say that certain immigration policies by the Trump administration may **hurt the economy**. They worry that strict rules could reduce the number of workers and slow down business growth. At the same time, experts are still **assessing** the effects of immigration changes from the second Trump administration. This means they are carefully looking at what worked and what did not. Understanding these policies matters because immigration affects jobs, communities, and the overall economy. We can expect more discussions about how to balance border safety with economic needs in the near future.

## 3. Amazon Layoffs Signal Tough Times for Tech Industry ![Article 3](/images/news/2026-02-06-3.png)

Amazon announced layoffs that will affect hundreds of jobs in the Bay Area. This is another sign that the tech industry is facing a **rough road ahead**. Many tech companies are cutting jobs after growing rapidly during past years. The layoffs show that businesses want to reduce costs because of economic uncertainties. For workers, this is a worrying time, as job security decreases. It also means the tech market may change, with fewer new hires and slower growth. Experts expect the industry to adjust and find new directions soon.

In Silicon Valley, tech workers are **campaigning** to get ICE, the US immigration enforcement, out of cities. These workers believe ICE’s presence harms immigrant communities and creates fear. Their campaign involves protests, petitions, and asking companies to cut ties with ICE. This movement shows how tech employees want to use their voices for social change. It also reflects a growing trend where workers want companies to take stands on political and human rights issues. The results of this campaign could affect local policies and corporate decisions soon.
